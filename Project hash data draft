/*
Constraints:
    1. The numbers assigned to employees are 5 digit each and initially the company can assign
       the numbers to a maximum of 1000 employees.
    2. The number assigned to each employee can be reassigned to some other employee in future
       if the earlier one leaves the company and some new employee joins.

    Using Hash Data Structure write the algorithm/pseudo-code and implementation as well, for
    this set-up. Each record should have these three fields: - ID, Name, Ph_No. Initialize all 1000
    numbers first starting from 11111, 11112 and so on.
    The program should have following features:
        1. Adding a record for new employee based on ID.
        2. Display all the records at any moment of time
        3. Deleting the employee based on ID, but retain the number assigned to it as is.
        4. Searching a particular employee either by phone_no or ID.


Approach:
    1.Initialize the table sixe T_S.
    2. Create a Hash Table.
    3. Declare a key K and Value V;
    4.Create a constructor to create a table
    5.Create a hasfunction() to return the key
    6.Create a functions to insert, remove, search data.
    7.Create a drop list to take input for operations.
    8.Take input and print the result.
    9. END
