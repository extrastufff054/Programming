languages can be used: C
• This assignment is graded assignment and mandatory.
• The deadline to submit the assignment is 12th September.
A telecommunication company wants to setup a trail for its employees by assigning a
dedicated contact number to communicate abroad with their clients so as to have every
communication internally. Initially they plan to have a trial for 2 years, with the below
constraints:
1. The numbers assigned to employees are 5 digit each and initially the company can assign
the numbers to a maximum of 1000 employees.
2. The number assigned to each employee can be reassigned to some other employee in future
if the earlier one leaves the company and some new employee joins.
Using Hash Data Structure write the algorithm/pseudo-code and implementation as well, for
this set-up. Each record should have these three fields: - ID, Name, Ph_No. Initialize all 1000
numbers first starting from 11111, 11112 and so on.
The program should have following features:
1. Adding a record for new employee based on ID.
2. Display all the records at any moment of time
3. Deleting the employee based on ID, but retain the number assigned to it as is.
4. Searching a particular employee either by phone_no or ID.
